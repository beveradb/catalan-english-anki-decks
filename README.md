# catalan-english-anki-decks
Anki (spaced repetition vocabulary learning app) decks to help me learn Catalan.

One of the things which I've found is that when I need to do something I find hard or dislike, the best way to convince myself to do it is to add some sort of technology interest to the mix.
I find language learning very difficult for a number of reasons, and unfortunately most of the usual technology options (e.g. Duolingo) aren't available for learning Catalan.

Additionally, despite my wife being Catalan, we live, work and socialise in English, so there are only usually a few days a year where I'm around Catalan native speakers.
As such, I've struggled with retaining vocabulary I've learned in the past, as my rate of learning has been slow and I haven't been reinforcing those memories.

While doing a bit of research, I came across an interesting [TED talk by Gabriel Wyner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBMfg4WkKL8).
He proposed that the best way to learn languages is to put stories, pictures and sounds along with each thing one learns, so the brain forms stronger memories in the associations with those more graphic medias.
The company he runs have built an application, fluent-forever.com which aims to allow people to learn languages in a new way by leveraging this idea.
Sadly, they also don't support Catalan.

However, it turns out the core concept of "spaced repetition" with flashcards isn't new, and there's a popular cross-platform open source application called Anki with a variety of community-contributed "decks" of flashcards.

For me, the "tech interest" here to trick myself into keeping up the learning is this git repository itself.
By committing new flashcards into my own deck as I follow along the online [Parla.cat courses](http://www.parla.cat) I hope to keep up my own interest and keep at it.

Additionally, for an added benefit I hope to create the flashcards themselves in a rich way with images in every card, and contribute them back to the AnkiWeb community once each unit is complete.
This way, I hope to add a secondary interest of "giving something back" rather than it being a purely solo endeavour.

Anyway, this readme is long enough - hope this all makes sense, and if this is of interest to anyone else out there who comes across it, feel free to reach out!
